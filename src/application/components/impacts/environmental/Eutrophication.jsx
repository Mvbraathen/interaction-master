                            Increase of nutrients in a body of water, causing structural changes to an ecosystem. Eutrophication can be the result of mining activities (god, copper, cobalt, etc.) and run-offs from mining activities, such as acid mine drainage. Eutrophication is also found in bodies of water near sites of electronics manufacturing as a result of emissions of waste water containing toxic materials, as well as in bodies of water near sites where electronics are disassembled.
