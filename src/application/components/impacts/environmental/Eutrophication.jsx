                                Eutrophication refers to the increase of nutrients in a body of water, causing
                                structural changes to an ecosystem. Eutrophication can be the result of mining
                                activities (gold, copper, cobalt, etc.) and run-offs from mining activities, such as
                                
                                {' '}

                                Eutrophication is also found in bodies of water near sites of
                                electronics manufacturing as a result of emissions of wastewater containing
                                toxic materials, as well as in bodies of water near sites where electronics are
                                disassembled.
