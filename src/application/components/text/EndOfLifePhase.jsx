                End of life is the phase in which the mobile phone is no longer in 
                use as the result of planned, functional or perceived obsolescence 
                of the phone. These mobile phones disappear in dusty drawers, get 
                sold or are repaired or thrown away. In countries with a functional 
                electronic waste collection system, mobile phones are recycled so 
                that valuable minerals can be re-used. Sometimes only the 
                motherboard (PCB) is take out for recycling and the rest is burned, 
                resulting in the release of hazardous materials in water and air.
