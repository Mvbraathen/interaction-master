                <h3> Social and Environmental Impacts in the Mobile Phone Lifecycle </h3>
                <p>This website enables you to explore the impacts of the mobile phone lifecycle on
                social and environmental sustainability.</p> 

                <p><strong>Social sustainability</strong> is about the
                minimum standards of living conditions and human rights below which people
                can be said to be living in deprivation. The twelve dimensions of the social
                foundation are derived from internationally agreed minimum social standards,
                as identified by the world’s governments in the Sustainable Development Goals
                in 2015. The twelve social dimensions are food, health, education, income &amp;
                work, water &amp; sanitation, energy, gender equality, social equity, housing, political
                voice, peace &amp; justice, and networks.</p>
                <p><strong>Environmental sustainability</strong> refers here to the non-negotiable planetary
                preconditions that humanity needs to respect in order to avoid the risk of
                deleterious or even catastrophic environmental change. The nine boundaries are
                climate change, novel entities, ozone depletion, aerosol loading, ocean
                acidification, biochemical flows, freshwater use, land-system change, and
                biosphere integrity.</p>

                <p>In order to learn more about these impacts in the different lifecycle phases,
                interact with the circular menu on the left.</p>
