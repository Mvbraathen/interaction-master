                            Food, as a social dimension, refers to the percentage of the population 
                            that is undernourished. In our study, this social dimension refers the 
                            pollution of the food chain with hazardous materials, resulting in 
                            contaminated food for human consumption. Food chain pollution undermines 
                            food security and results in reduced health. Food chain pollution is 
                            found in mining areas, where grazing lands and crops are contaminated 
                            with toxic elements released into air and in areas where e-waste is 
                            disassembled.
