                	Solid and liquid particles in the air, organic and inorganic, mostly hazardous. Mining and smelting operations produce a large amount of particulate matter, containing a wide variety of materials, such as iron, aluminium, mercury, etc. Particulate matter emissions are also related to the use of diesel vehicles.
